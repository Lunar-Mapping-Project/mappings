## FAQ

#### Where are the mappings?

The mappings are still incomplete and have not yet been converted into an intermediate format to be matched with the latest version of lunar client.

However, you can find 'dirty' mappings in the [releases](https://github.com/Lunar-Mapping-Project/mappings/releases) for specific versions of lunar.
