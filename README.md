ðŸŒŒ The mappings repository for the lunar mapping project.

## Updates

Great news, the mapping team have reached the mid 90%s on a more recent version of lunar (93d4dd4/master), which also includes all platform modules, genesis & ichor!<br>
We are currently in the process of cleaning up the mappings, and getting all the files ready for release to the public.<br>

## Contents

## FAQ

#### Where are the mappings?

The mappings are still incomplete and have not yet been converted into an intermediate format to be matched with the latest version of lunar client.

However, you can find 'dirty' mappings in the [releases](https://github.com/Lunar-Mapping-Project/mappings/releases) for specific versions of lunar.
